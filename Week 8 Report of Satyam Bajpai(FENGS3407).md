### <u>Tasks Completed</u>

- ### Weekly Meet with Prof. Kumar on 03/07/2021

  - Had weekly meet with Prof. Kumar on 03/07/2021 where we discussed about the physics behind field equations for large and small aperture( photoconductive gap) antenna:

  - **Small Gap Antenna**

    - Infinitesimal small antenna dl(length of photoconductive gap) << lambda (Hertzian Antenna).

      ![](https://github.com/satyam741/GIPEDI-Week-8-Report/blob/main/small2.JPG?raw=true)

    - Can be considered as equivalent to a constant current current source of Ipc.dl & constant vector potential.

    - After writing the equations in spherical polar coordinates and then using Maxwell's Equations we got H and in turn E.

    - Then after considering time domain characteristics by multiplying exp(jwt) & getting real parts of the field we finally obtained:

       ![](https://github.com/satyam741/GIPEDI-Week-8-Report/blob/main/small1.JPG?raw=true)

      Note: Here we also considered the time delay that will occur in reaching the EM (THz here) Wave from source to observation point, as td= t- (r/c)

    - After observing the equations we can say that since E theta and H phi have (1/r) as a common factor while in the Er equation (1/r^2) common, so for far fields first two components of the field i.e. H phi and E theta are radiative components.

    - Then using I=dq/dt we further solved the field equations which finally depends **on the derivative of the current(or directly proportional to current density)**.

    - Now, using current density equation Jpc= - e*n(t) *v(t) and using Drude' s model equations for change in carrier density due to capture/trap sites in mid band gaps and using equation for rate of change of carrier velocity. Finally, we arrived at the equation for THz Field (E) which concludes that **as we increase bias field, E local increases, hence dv/dt increase and hence we get larger THz radiation field**:

         ![](https://github.com/satyam741/GIPEDI-Week-8-Report/blob/main/small3.JPG?raw=true)

      

  - **Large Aperture Antenna**

    - Here, we can't consider the antenna as equivalent to a constant current source since here l >> lambda (wave length) of THz wave. So instead, here we used Js as current density and S as the photoexcited area of the antenna gap and then using integration of small pieces (infinitesimal small) we can proceed in similar fashion as before.

    - We write field equation using Maxwell's equation E= -j* w*A & here since l >> lambda so the field can be assumed as plane waves and hence we can apply boundary condition at air- substrate interface to get:

    - Using above equations and using Ohm's law i.e. J = sigma*E we finally get J (current density) as a function of E bias :

      ![](https://github.com/satyam741/GIPEDI-Week-8-Report/blob/main/large3.JPG?raw=true)

       *here (eeta)o is intrinsic impedance = sqrt(mu/epsilon).

    - Finally we put this equation in the E field equation for l>> lambda:

      ![](https://github.com/satyam741/GIPEDI-Week-8-Report/blob/main/large4.JPG?raw=true)

    - From the above equation we conclude that the **large aperture antenna fields relies on surface current density and applied bias to antenna electrodes**.

  - As guided by Prof. Kumar I uploaded my weekly work/ progress on the project on the Google Drive and also added my presentation that I gave last week after making some changes as guided by sir in week 7.

  - In the meeting sir also asked me to start writing the final report, but since I had to go to my college for collection of my hostel luggage this week, so I was not able to work much on my PC this week, however I made a basic structure of my report on a copy which makes the task easier while writing on PC. 

- ### Weekly Meet with Prof. Kar on 02/07/2021

  - Had weekly meet with Prof. Kar on 02/07/2021 where sir discussed about Silence: where mind and intellect talk to each other and we learn how to control our senses ( manage the horses ).

  - Prof. Kar also discussed about various career opportunities that one may pursue and guided us to to use every course as an arrow in a quiver which will work as a window to what can be done next.
